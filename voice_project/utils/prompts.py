"""
Prompt templates module for the Voice Assistant.

This module contains the system prompts used by different components of the
Voice Assistant. These prompts are designed to guide the language models in
performing specific tasks such as document selection, research analysis, and
response summarization.

The module includes three main prompts:
1. docs_prompt: For selecting relevant documents
2. research_prompt: For analyzing research paper content
3. summary_prompt: For synthesizing and summarizing responses

Each prompt is carefully crafted to:
- Provide clear instructions to the model
- Maintain consistent output formats
- Ensure comprehensive and relevant responses
