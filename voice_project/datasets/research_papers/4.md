Abstract
Glia are increasingly appreciated as serving an important function in the control of sleep and circadian rhythms. Glial cells in Drosophila
and mammals regulate daily rhythms of locomotor activity and sleep as well as homeostatic rebound following sleep deprivation. In
addition, they contribute to proposed functions of sleep, with different functions mapping to varied glial subtypes. Here, we discuss
recent findings in Drosophila and rodent models establishing a role of glia in circadian or sleep regulation of synaptic plasticity, brain
metabolism, removal of cellular debris, and immune challenges. These findings underscore the relevance of glia for benefits attrib-
uted to sleep and have implications for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying sleep and associated disorders.

Figure 2. Summary of the diverse circadian and sleep-regulated functions served by glial cells. Glial cells, integrate sleep and circadian rhythms by
interacting with neural networks that maintain homeostasis and regulate local sleep dynamics through astrocytic modulation of cortical states. They
contribute to synaptic plasticity by removing excess dendritic synapses and support glycogen and energy metabolism through the tripartite synapse,
which involves neurotransmitters and signaling molecules such as glutamate, ATP, adenosine, GABA, and D-serine. During sleep, glial cells influence
blood–brain barrier permeability, facilitate lipid metabolism for mitochondrial energy production, and enhance autophagic activity to clear toxic
waste, such as clearance of Tau and Amyloid-β, thereby playing a neuroprotective role. Additionally, they modulate immune responses by activating
pathways such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kB signaling, underscoring their importance in brain health and homeostasis. Adapted from [45,
