The dataset was collected from a sleep center named Haaglanden Medisch Centrum (HMC, The Netherlands). The initial data files contain different types of signals. We selected EEG signals from multiple locations:

- F4 from the frontal lobe (controls voluntary movements)
- C4 from the central lobe (handles thoughts and analytical activities) 
- O2 from the occipital lobe (responsible for vision)

To characterize sleep stages, the EEG is divided into five frequency subbands:
- Delta waves: 0-4 Hz
- Theta waves: 4-8 Hz  
- Alpha waves: 8-12 Hz
- Beta waves: 12-30 Hz
- Gamma waves: >30 Hz

Dataset details:
- 154 sleep recordings
- 75 features per recording
- Original classifications: Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM

Preprocessing:
- Removed all Wake-classified rows
- Merged N1, N2, N3 classes into a single NREM class
- Final classes: NREM, REM
