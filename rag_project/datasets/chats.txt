You can measure this by counting steps over a known distance (like a track).\n3.  **GPS Auto-Calibration:** The most common way is to ensure you regularly record outdoor walks or runs using GPS. Your tracker uses the accurate distance from GPS and your step count during those activities to learn and refine your average stride length. The more GPS activities you record, the better the calibration generally becomes for indoor estimates.\n4.  **Treadmill Calibration (Specific Feature):** Some advanced trackers have a specific 'Treadmill Calibration' feature you can run after a treadmill workout to adjust the recorded distance to match the treadmill's display.",
